|GENERAL|
- All packs are generally collated when printed. Rather than worry about this, I randomly
	generate the contents of a pack based on card rarity.

|SPECIFIC SETS|
	
	|Arabian Nights| 
	- Did not monkey with U1, U2, etc. All cards are either common or uncommon. No cards 
		are duplicated, so the site considers it a 78 card set.
	
	|Antiquities|
	- As above, all cards were assigned simply common or uncommon. No duplicate lands were
		included (Mishra's Factory, Mishra's Workshop and Urzatron all have one art)
